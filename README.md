# YouTube Downloader

A program designed to do one thing and do it well; download YouTube content! Made with Avalonia so it looks cool and modern.


## Purpose

I frequently find myself wanting to download a YouTube video, looking up "youtube downloader". I am then swiftly and painfully reminded that just about every downloader on the internet is flooded with ads, slow as rocks, and provides only low quality options (if you even get any options). Even worse; you have to visit individual sites specifically for audio/video only streams and thumbnails. 

YouTube Downloader aims to do away with this necessary evil once and for all by providing a simple, polished, and intuitive way to grab anything you need from YouTube at any quality you please.

## How to Use

**Basic Instructions**
1. Copy and past a YouTube link into the textbox labeled "URL", then click the "Submit" button next to it

**Downloading Video**

2. By default, the highest quality download will be selected; however, you can change it if need be by clicking the dropdown menu and selecting a different quality

3. Clicking the download button located on the bottom left corner will prompt you to select a name and location to save your video. Your download will begin after you have selected, and you will recieve a notification when it finishes. (If the video you're saving has special characters in the title, you might need to chage the name of the file before you save it)

**Downloading Audio**

3. Clicking the download button located on the bottom left corner will prompt you to select a name and location to save your audio.
